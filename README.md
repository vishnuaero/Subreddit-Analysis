# Subreddit-Analysis
Are you curious which subreddits are popular on Reddit? Which subreddits appear more on r/popular and r/all? Are some subreddits promoted by vested interests? This script might give you answers.

Why did I write this code?
Not any specific reason. But I never had any experience interacting with an API. After learning the basics of python, I wanted to scrap data from different websites. To get started, I thought why not scrap our own favorite website. I read around and found that, among APIs, PRAW is one of the easiest and most documented API. It was also easy to work with. 

So when a user visits reddit, he/she is taken to r/popular. This code scraps both r/popular and r/all to see which subreddit appears often. My end game is to see if there is any trend (like some subreddits being aggressively promoted,during elections etc.). I will post results after the November election. 

The script is automatically run using windows tasks scheduler and is usually run every hour. 

Please let me know how my code looks and how can I improve it. Any suggestion will be extremely valuable.
